# Bell-s-Palsy-Severity-detection

This project presents a deep learning-based system for automated severity detection of Bell’s Palsy—a neurological disorder causing sudden facial paralysis. The model utilizes ResNet-50 architecture with transfer learning to classify severity into four levels: Mild, Moderate, Moderate Severe, and Severe.
